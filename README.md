# DEVELOPING GAMES WITH UNITY

----


### INTRODUCTION

Back in the day, game development wasn't for everyone. You needed your own game engine, it required a strong math knowledge, you had to choose the platform that would run your game, and it was very expensive to release a game. With the release of Unity in 2005, however, everything changed. 


Unity is a game engine that tries to standarize game development by providing a professional tool for independent game developers in an accessible way. Unity offers a lot of advantadges:

* It's free.

* It's cross-platform. So, once your game is finished, you can export it to many platforms such as Windows, IOS, Linux, game systems and more.

* It's powerful. It's not just for indie games. Unity has been used in AAA games such as Hearthstone, Pokémon Go and Mario Run.

* Live debugging. You can run your videogame instantly, while at the same time you can change parameters or modify game objects.

* Asset Store. Unity provides an internal store where you can buy (or download for free) any resources that you need.
